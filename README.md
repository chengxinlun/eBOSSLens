## Use at own risk

## TO-DO list:
* Complete objectifing the code for QSO, LyA, jackpot lensing
* Further improve in parameter configuration
* Write a better document

## Note for further improver
* Search for ''''#TODO'''' in the project for the parts need to be modified
* Parameters/returns of functions might also be modified if needed
* Use ''''os.path.join'''' instead of adding strings to form directory/filename
* ''''topdir'''' has been removed since it could be merged into ''''savedir''''
* Main calculation function is ''''eBOSSLens.eBOSSLens''''. ''''main.py'''' is only an example of how to invoke the function
