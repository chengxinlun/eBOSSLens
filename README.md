# eBOSSLens
## Currently under refactoring. Galaxy lensing should be working. 
## !!! Refactoring is done in structure. Full testing is underway.
## Use at own risk

## TO-DO list:
* QSO-Galaxy is stable on paper candidates (full blind test to do)
* Full test of all 4 cases (Gal-Gal, Gal-LAE, QSO-LAE, Jackpot)
* Blind search parallelization optimization
* Further improve in parameter configuration (i.e. using json config file)
* Write a better document (invoke function descriptions + minimal example)

## Notes
* Search for `#TODO` in the project for the parts need to be modified
* Parameters/returns of functions might also be modified if necessary
* Main calculation function is `eBOSSLens.eBOSSLens`
* `main.py` is only an example of how to invoke the function
* Document could be written in source code file
